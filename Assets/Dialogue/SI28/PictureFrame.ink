A picture frame… What was the picture about?

 +[School, maybe?]
    I can picture… children. Mine? Or was I the child? When was it?
    
 +[Something fun, like a party or a trip?]
    I went with someone, I think. But who?
 
 +[A wedding?]
    But was it mine? It reminds me of true love, eternal love. But then, why can’t I remember?
 
 +[My head hurts. Pain. I don’t want to remember.]
