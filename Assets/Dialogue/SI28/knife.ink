 +[An unpleasant memory?]
    An argument over supper, maybe? If only I could remember with whom...
    
 +[It's not supposed to be there, is it?]
    It is dangerous to keep a knife in the middle of the kitchen. Anyone could cut themselves accidentally.
 
 +[A strange but pleasant smell?]
    It reminds me of tender meat... and blood... Blood?!
 
 +[I don't want to remember.]
